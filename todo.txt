##### to do #####
- a working list of features to maybe add at some point

### frontend ###
1. style categories differently
    - ex: give each category own background color
2. preset 'inspiration' ingredient combos
    - doesn't require user to input ingredients
        - probably could accomplish this by getting drinks w/o any specified ingredients
            - but this is more intutive
    - demonstrates functionality to first-time users
    - helps users see breadth of ingredient base
    - if put above ingredient entry autocompletes, could change vibe of site (in a positive way)
    - should be randomly generated by server on ingredient request
3. list a few related ingredients as clickable cards floated right on dropdown suggestions
    - helps users see breadth of ingredient base
    - tricks users into think algo is sophisticated
4. list total volume of each ingredient used across all drinks for a user-specified number of servings
    - would need to combine reciepes into common units
    - follow ups:
        4.1. allow user to specifiy they have a limited quanity of specific ingredient, algo would not over allocate
            - need to make HMI nice and streamlined
        4.2. list where user can buy given quanity of ingredients: safeway, amazon, etc
            - then could list total price of given drinks
5. use local storage to track ingredients user listed as having
6. have preset clickable groups of common ingredients to streamline user entering ingredients they have
    - ex: 'common household spices' or 'commomn condiments', etc

### backend ###
1. use cookies to track user preferences for better recs
    - would need to implement post-drink rating system
    - algo would need to be careful not to overfit to a few ratings
    - algo would need to be >90% performant on first visit
    - follow ups:
        1.1. have user take short (<= 3 question) preference quiz on visit to website, treat answers as ratings
        1.2. bias algo not to show drinks has previously shown user
2. various rec algo improvements
    2.1. add random shuffle
    2.2. add bonus/penalty based on drink type or glass type
    2.3. add bonus for drinks with descriptions
    2.4. make recs 2, 3 based on set of previous recs
        - after 1st rec generated, for following recs set preferred_ingredients = current drink ingredient set (only_preferred_ingredients = false)
        - that way followin recs use as many overlapping ingredients as possible
