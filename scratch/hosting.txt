##### hosting scratch #####

1. need hosting service
    - preliminary options
        - digital ocean
        - aws
        - heroku
        - netlify

2. security?

3. keep postgres in AWS or migrate to new hosting service?
4. how to enabke analytics
5. how to enable logging
6. CDN?

### hosting service ###
1. Digital Ocean
    - droplet === VM
    - 'basic droplet': shared CPU
        - 'bursty apps'
        - low traffic web servers
        - starting at $5/month
            - 'premium' guaranteed to use 'one of latest 2 generations of CPUs' & NVMe SSDs, 'enhanced memory performance'
        - from 1vCPU/1GB mem to 8 vCPU/16GB mem
    - recommend scaling via benchmarking, provide tools
    - provides scaling tools:
        - spaces: CDN
        - load balancer: distribute traffic between 3 droplets
        - firewall
        - backups
        - managed DBs
    - managed DBs
        - start at $15/month
        - includes postgres
        - free daily backups

2. AWS
    - aws hosting solutions
        - amplify: single page apps built on frameworks like vue
            <- think this only allows serverless apps
        - lightsail: low traffic, frequent changes, unlikely to scale past 5 servers, self-managed DNS, networking, server
            <- seems to allow node backend
        - s3: serverless static sites with occasional high traffic, infrequent changes
        - ec2: multiple servers across 2+ data centers, high CPU use, load balancing, etc
    - lightsail
        - tools
            - CDN
            - load balancers
            - DNS maangement
    - pricing
        - virtual server
            - $3.50/month : 1 CPU, 512 MB mem, 20 GB SSD
            - $5/month    : 1 CPU, 1 GB mem, 40 GB SSD
            - $10/month   : 2 CPU, 1 GB mem, 60 GB SSD
        - container
            - $7/month    : 0.25 vCPU, 512 MB mem
            - $10/month   : 0.25 vCPU, 1 GB mem
        - managed DB
            - $15/month: standard
        - CDN
            - $10/month (1st year free)
        - load balancer: $18/month

<- decision: DIGITAL OCEAN (for now)
    - want to try new cloud service
