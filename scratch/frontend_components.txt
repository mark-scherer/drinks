1. Vuetify
    - tried to use "vue add vuetify"
        - had alot of difficulty with vue add changes but finally caught on and replicated in what I had implemented
    - found for Vue 3, need to use Vuetify 3+ (alpha): https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vue-cli-plugins/issues/140#issuecomment-716126367
    - found Vuetify 3+ doesn't yet support autocomplete 
        - see "What is included in the Alpha?" https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#table-of-contents
        - see list of supported components via API in sidebar
        - need v-autocomplete, not supported yet

2. npm vue3-autocomplete
    - https://github.com/Takachi67/vue3-autocomplete
    - very few downloads but might be a good starting spot for dev

3. vue-tags-input
    - http://www.vue-tags-input.com/#/
    - unclear if works w/ vue 3
    - seems well documented
    - no repo to clone, only npm install
    - could be good starting spot

4. vue-autosuggest
    - https://github.com/darrenjennings/vue-autosuggest
    - demo: https://darrenjennings.github.io/vue-autosuggest/
    - doesn't support multiple
    - seems somewhat minimal
    - complicated src

5. v-autocomplete
    - https://github.com/paliari/v-autocomplete
    - demo: https://paliari.github.io/v-autocomplete/
    - doesn't support multiple
    - unclear if supports vue 3 <- is old, probably doesn't

6. vue-simple-suggest
    - https://github.com/KazanExpress/vue-simple-suggest
    - demo: https://kazanexpress.github.io/vue-simple-suggest/
    - doesn't support multiple
    - does support formatting of results
    - is repo

7. make our own
    - use this guide: https://medium.com/@fareez_ahamed/make-your-own-autocomplete-component-quickly-using-vue-js-21a642e8b140

### choice ###
- making our own
    - none are that close
        - multi-selection might be hard, might had to look at example
    - hard to tell if any support vue 3...
