1. Vuetify
    - tried to use "vue add vuetify"
        - had alot of difficulty with vue add changes but finally caught on and replicated in what I had implemented
    - found for Vue 3, need to use Vuetify 3+ (alpha): https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vue-cli-plugins/issues/140#issuecomment-716126367
    - found Vuetify 3+ doesn't yet support autocomplete 
        - see "What is included in the Alpha?" https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#table-of-contents
        - see list of supported components via API in sidebar
        - need v-autocomplete, not supported yet
