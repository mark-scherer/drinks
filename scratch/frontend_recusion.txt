### frontend unended recursion issue scratch ###

- began after adding basic grouping functionality to frontend (a4b24bf4ddd5fa22fb1d3bd752de675482d23141)
- on load, get two 'Maximum recursive updates exceeded' errors:
    1. App.updateIngredients() > App.getIngredients().then()
        - when setting this.ingredients = ingredients
    2. Autocomplete.matches() > _.forEach() > if (choice.category === 'group')
        - setting choice.childre = _.map(choice.children, ...)

- complete error message
    - 'Error: Maximum recursive updates exceeded'
    - 'This means you have a reactive effect that is mutating its own dependencies and thus recursively triggering itself'
    - 'Possible sources include component template, render function, updated hook or watcher source function'

- theories
    - case 2: Autocomplete.matches()
        - matches is computed
        - matches is updating it's own input (choice.children)
        - matches recalls itself on its own update endlessly
    <- confirmed! removing Autocomplete.matches()'s update of choice.children stopped both endless recursion warning

- solutions
    - copy input to a tmp var before updating
        <- worked!
