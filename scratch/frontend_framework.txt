##### Frontend Framework Scratch #####

- 05/10/2021
- current progress
    - frontend: not started
    - backend:
        - rec engine works but is rather simple
        - server just has GET /drinks

### pre-thoughts ###
- want to try something other than react
- could be: Angular, Vue

- sources
    1. https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react/

- popularity
    - job demand
        - angular & react tied, Vue in 3rd w/ 20% as much
    - git interaction
        - vue ahead, then react then angular much lower

- performance
    - size
        - no unreasonable differences

- Angular
    - oldest, released in 2010 by Google
        - Angular 2 released in 2016
    - typescript based
    - component = 'directive'
        - UI part controlled by html
        - behaviors controlled by JS code
    - steep learning curve
    - complete framework

- Vue
    - created by ex-Googler in 2014
        - Vue 3.0 released in 2020
    - easiest to learn
    - 'higher customizability'
    - styles and code inside .vue files
    - vue creates 'data object' which can be freely updated in contrast to react's state object
    - vue allows 'two-way-binding'
        - user updating a data input will update tied var
        - code updating var will also update data field
    - child objects emit events heard by parents
        - in react, children call parent functions passed down via this.props

- React
    - released by FB in 2013
    - used extensively by FB
    - medium learning curve
    - not a complete framework

### Decision ###
<- vue
    - simplest to learn and growing in popularity
    - very open source
    - seems to get rid of annoying parts of react
        - state
        - passing functions down to children
